# üåê What is the Node Network?

The Node Network is an initiative by Mi Primer Bitcoin aimed at decentralizing education. It's a global network of grassroots Bitcoin communities and educational initiatives, each teaching the [Bitcoin Diploma](https://github.com/MyFirstBitcoin/Bitcoin-Diploma-2024) and using educational resources that are created and provided by Mi Primer Bitcoin in an open-source manner.
